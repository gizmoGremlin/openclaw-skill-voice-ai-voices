# Voice.ai Voices

High-quality voice synthesis with 9 personas, 11 languages, streaming, and voice cloning using the Voice.ai API.

Requires Node.js 18+.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Set API key (recommended)
echo 'VOICE_AI_API_KEY=your-key-here' > .env

# Generate speech
node scripts/tts.js --text "Hello world!" --voice ellie

# Streaming for long text
node scripts/tts.js --text "Once upon a time..." --voice lilith --stream
```

## Configuration

The CLI looks for `VOICE_AI_API_KEY` in this order:
1. Environment variable
2. Skill-local `.env` file

## API Endpoint

The SDK uses `https://dev.voice.ai`, which is the official Voice.ai production API domain.

## Voices

Voice definitions live in `voices.json`. Use the CLI with `--voice <name>`:

```
ellie, oliver, lilith, smooth, shadow, sakura, zenith, flora, commander
```
